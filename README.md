I think Github branching could be useful.

When you create a branch, you’re making a copy of the original branch as it was at that point in time (like a photo snapshot). If the original branch changes while you’re working on your new branch, no worries, you can always pull in those updates.


You may have, at some point in your life, saved different versions of a file like, “story.txt”, “story-joe-edit.txt”, “story-sue-edit.txt”. Branches accomplish the same goals but are easier to manage on GitHub repositories.

At GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a feature or fix is ready, the branch is merged into master.


Open a Pull Request

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you make a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone pull in your contribution - aka merge them into their branch. GitHub’s Pull Request feature allows you to compare the content on two branches. The changes, additions and subtractions, are shown in green and red and called diffs (differences).

As soon as you make a change, you can open a Pull Request. People use Pull Requests to start a discussion about commits (code review) even before the code is finished. This way you can get feedback as you go or help when you’re stuck.

By using GitHub’s @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.
