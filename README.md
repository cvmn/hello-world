I think Github branching could be useful.

When you create a branch, you’re making a copy of the original branch as it was at that point in time (like a photo snapshot). If the original branch changes while you’re working on your new branch, no worries, you can always pull in those updates.


You may have, at some point in your life, saved different versions of a file like, “story.txt”, “story-joe-edit.txt”, “story-sue-edit.txt”. Branches accomplish the same goals but are easier to manage on GitHub repositories.

At GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a feature or fix is ready, the branch is merged into master.
